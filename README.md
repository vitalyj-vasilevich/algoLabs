# algoLabs
This repository stores the solutions of the tasks on a subject called Algorithm Theory. 
Every task that appears here has successfully passed through all the tests in my university's testing system.
Due to the testing system, there are some code style restrictions, so the code might not be "clean" sometimes.
The main thing about this code is that it works for the required time, and fits other requirements,
for example the estimated computational complexity of the algorithm.
Most of the tasks will probably be coded using C++, so I will write something like "C# code" in a commit message of the task, if it is written in C#.
